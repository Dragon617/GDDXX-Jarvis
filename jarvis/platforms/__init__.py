"""The few things that differ between macOS and Windows, behind one set of functions.

  open_path(p)                 show a file or folder in the system's own app
  open_camera(want, send)      an OpenCV capture of the front camera (asks for permission where the OS needs it)
  hand_detector()              finds hands in a camera frame: detect(frame_bgr) -> [{joint: (x, y)}]
                               (x, y mirrored, 0..1 from the top-left, joints named as in gesture.py)
  ocr(path)                    text boxes on an image: [{"t", "x", "y", "w", "h"}], 0..1 from the top-left
  autostart(on)                open Jarvis when the user logs in (the morning briefing needs it)

macOS uses Apple's built-in Vision framework; Windows and Linux use MediaPipe and RapidOCR (pip packages).
